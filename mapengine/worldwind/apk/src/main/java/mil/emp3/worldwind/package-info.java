 * You can either build an AAR or an APK that encapsulates the map engine and associated glue code. Once built you have two options for using the
 * map engine. One is to compile the the AAR in your application and other is to to install the APK to your target devices and have EMP3 load it dynamically
 * at run time. Please take a look at the documentation in emp3-android-sdk-view for associating a specific map engine with a give instance of the map.
