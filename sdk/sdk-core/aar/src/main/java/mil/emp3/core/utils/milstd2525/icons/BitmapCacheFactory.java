/**
 * This will create the BitmapCache that you want to deploy.
 *
 * Currently three types of Cache implementations are supported
 *
 * BitmapCache - Caches WeakReferences to Bitmaps and releases and reclaims nodes as Bitmaps are garbage collected. This mechanism did not work well
 *     in the tests we performed, hence we started investigating further and developed AdaptiveBitmapCache
 *
 * AdaptiveBitmapCache - This reduces Mid Distance Threshold as we reach the preset memory usage limit and increases the MDT as memory usage returns to
 *     normal. This return to normal logic isn't working well because of the way World Wind is handling the Bitmaps. This lead to the NoBitmapCache
 *
 * NoBitmapCache doesn't cache anything, it depends on underlying map engine to manage the render cache. Cache was created so that we can continue
 *     to use the methods that build an ImageInfo when it is required.
 *
 * Here is a brief explanation of why Bitmap caching by EMP will NOT work, it also answers the question about multiple map instances:
 *
 * Java objects are shareable between map instances, assuming those instances share a common Java VM. This includes Placemark, PlacemarkAttributes,
 * and ImageSource. Note that when an app uses ImageSource.BitmapFactory the bitmap instances are quickly converted to OpenGL textures and discarded,
 * so sharing bitmap instances becomes irrelevant.
 * OpenGL objects are currently not shareable between map instances. Each map instance has its own OpenGL context and its own render resource cache
 * on the native heap. Each map instance therefore has its own OpenGL texture for a placemark image, regardless of whether an app uses
 * ImageSource.fromBitmap or ImageSource.fromBitmapFactory. Note that it's possible to configure an OpenGL context to share texture objects,
 * but we have yet to implement this as it's not supported out of the box on Android.
